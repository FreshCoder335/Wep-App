# Overview

This project is a simple quiz web app that has quite a few aspects to funcitonality. It allows me to take a quiz with questions that randomize with every entry and for simplicity I only did three questions. The purpose for making this is that it teaches me a lot about how web apps acutally work and also a much bigger look into JavaScript and HTML. It allowed me to really explore a lot about funcitonality of different cause and effect style algorithms. Overall, it was a phenomenal learning experience.
